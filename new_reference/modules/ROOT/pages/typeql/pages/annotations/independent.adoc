= `@independent` annotation

The `@independent` annotation is used
// tag::overview[]
to prevent attributes without owners from being deleted automatically.
// end::overview[]

== Syntax

.Syntax
[,typeql]
----
<type label> @independent;
----

The `@independent` annotation does not accept any arguments.

== Usage

// tag::description[]
The `@independent` annotation enforces the `independent` constraint for an attribute type, allowing instances of the type to exist independently of their owner.
// end::description[]

// TODO: Add a reference to attributes and their dependency on existing owners

By default, attributes (instances of attribute types) depend on their owners:

* Attributes cannot be inserted without a `has` clause.
* Attributes are automatically deleted when their owners are deleted.

In contrast, attributes of independent types can exist without owners.

=== Subtyping

The `independent` constraint is inherited. This means that all subtypes of an independent type are also independent, and it cannot be changed.
