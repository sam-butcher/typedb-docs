= `@unique` annotation
:page-aliases: {page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/statements/unique.adoc

The `@unique` annotation is used
// tag::overview[]
to specify unique attributes for entities and relations.
// end::overview[]

== Syntax

.Syntax
[,typeql]
----
<type label> owns <attribute type label> @unique;
----

The `@unique` annotation does not accept any arguments.

== Usage

// tag::description[]
The `@unique` annotation can be defined for an ownership to put the `unique` constraint on it.
The `unique` constraint means that no two instances of the owner type (owners) can have instances of the attribute type (attributes) with the same _value._
That makes every owned attribute unique _by value_ among all instances of the owner type **and its subtypes**.
// end::description[]

For example, the following statement defines that every `user` should have a unique `phone`:

[,typeql]
----
include::{page-version}@new_reference::example$tql/schema_annotations.tql[tags=define-keyword;phone-attribute;unique]
----

With this constraint, no instance of `user` can share the same `phone` value.

[#subtyping]
=== Subtyping

The `unique` constraint would also affect the following schema extension:

[,typeql]
----
include::{page-version}@new_reference::example$tql/schema_annotations.tql[tags=define-keyword;phone-sub-attributes;unique-sub-entity]
----

With the `unique` constraint on the `phone`, there is a protection ensuring that:

- Any `user` can only have one unique `phone`.
- A `uk-user` cannot have a `uk-phone` with the same value as a `usa-user` 's `usa-phone`.

If there is a need to restrict uniqueness within subtypes (e.g., allowing `uk-user` and `usa-user` to have phones with overlapping values, but still unique within their respective regions), the `unique` constraint should be applied directly to the subtype ownerships instead.


== Limitations

Cannot be used with the xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/annotations/key.adoc[`@key` annotation] as they both produce the `unique` constraint.

See <<_value_types>> for the list of supported value types.
