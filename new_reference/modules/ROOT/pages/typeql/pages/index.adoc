This page gives an overview of the TypeQL query language. For an overview of the data model on which TypeQL queries are built see xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/data_model.adoc[here].

[[queries]]
== Queries and functions

The main way of interacting with your TypeDB database is through queries written in *TypeQL*, the query language of TypeDB. Queries fall into two categories.

1. *Schema queries* comprise a *single stage*, indicated by the corresponding keywords shown in the <<table1, table>> below. Schema queries modify the schema of your database, and produce no outputs except for a confirmation of success.
1. *Data pipelines* may comprise *multiple stages*, indicated by the keywords shown in the <<table1, table>> below. Data pipelines read and write data from the database, and always output of the read or written data (though the set of outputs may be empty).

<<table1, Table 1>> also mentions *functions*: functions are data pipeline templates that take typed input arguments. This allows users to build powerful query abstractions. Functions *cannot write or delete* data, and thus they cannot contain write stages like `insert` or `delete`.

[[statements]]
== Statements and patterns

The body of a stage comprises *statements*. For example:

* The body of a `define` stage comprises statements such as `user owns username`.
* The body of a `match` stage comprises statements such as `$u has username $n` or `$type owns username`.

Which statements can be used depends on the stage we are in.

A _key distinction_ between stages and their statements is whether statements contain variables or not.

* Statements without variables are called *definitions*.
* Statements with variables are called (elementary) *patterns*.

Patterns can be combined into larger patterns by xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/patterns/index.adoc[*pattern operations*], such as *conjunction* ("`chaining`"), *disjunction* ("`branching`"), *negation* ("`exclusion`"), etc.

=== Definition vs pattern statements

Definitions and patterns play distinct roles in TypeQL.

1. *_Schema queries always work with (lists of) definitions._*
1. *_Data pipelines (and functions) always work with patterns._*

As a simple example of this distinction, compare:
[,typeql]
----
define
  entity user, plays friendship:friend;
  relation friendship, relates friend @card(2);
----
with
[,typeql]
----
match
  $some-type plays $some-role;
  friendship relates $some-role;
----
The former query introduces types, while the latter will query for types. The general idea here is as follows.

=== Definition statements

Definitions in schema queries concern:

* *type* definitions, introducing new types via the appropriate keyword (`entity`, `relation` + `relates`, `attribute` + `value`). Types are referred to by a unique type *labels*; multiple aliases of the latter can be introduced (coming soon).
* *trait* definitions, introducing player or owner traits (via `plays` and `owns` keywords). Player traits allow type instances to be referred to as players in roles of relations. Owner traits allow type instances to be referred to as
* *subtyping* definitions, declare types to be subtypes of other types (via the keyword `sub`). Traits of supertypes are inherited by subtypes.

=== Pattern statements

In contrast, in patterns we support a wide variety of syntax, including for:

* *Retrieving types* based on label, traits, and inheritance.
* *Retrieving data* in types, e.g. based on references between data instance such as attribute ownerships and relation linkages (via keywords such as `has`, `links`, and anonymous versions thereof)
* Function calls (`let $a, $b in <FUN-CALL>`)
* Computation with values (`let $x = <EXPR>`)
* ... and many more.

=== Annotations

The semantics of many statements can be further modified with the use of *annotations* (which applies both to definition statements and pattern statements).

== Expressions and value types

TypeQL supports various build in operators to manipulate and combine data types, which can be used in the construction of statements (such as assignments and comparisons).
