= Scalar and tuple functions

Scalar and tuple functions are xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/functions/index.adoc#fun_types[function types] which return at most one row of outputs.

== Syntax

Single functions can be identified by their return type not containing curly braces `{}`.

.Scalar function return format
[,typeql]
----
<return-type>
----

.Tuple function return format
[,typeql]
----
<return-type-0>, ..., <return-type-N>
----

== Usage

Single functions are defined and called like any other function.
To retrieve the results of the called function, a simple assignment is enough (however, a general `in` used for xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/functions/stream.adoc[streamed] results is also allowed).

=== Transforming stream outputs to single outputs

TypeQL pipelines generally produce streams of results as not every query always returns a specific number of answers.
For example, the following example uses a query with a number of results based on the actual data and does not depend on schema constraints:

[#_transforming_general_example]
[,typeql]
----
include::{page-version}@new_reference::example$tql/read_statements_functions.tql[tags=match-users]
----

There are two main ways of transforming streams into single results: aggregation and stream modification.

==== Aggregation

// TODO: Add reference to built-in functions
A common case of single functions usage is calling for built-in aggregation functions.
These aggregations are usually scalar single functions by themselves, so calling them to aggregate a stream is a natural operation.

----

==== Stream modification

Imagine having function based on a query from <<_transforming_general_example, the previous example>>.
As already discussed, this function should return a stream of answers.

include::{page-version}@new_reference::example$tql/schema_statements_functions.tql[tags=fun-stream-users]
----

To make sure that there is maximum one result for a function, an instruction for picking this one result in case of ambiguity is required.
TypeQL supports two stream modification keywords for these purposes:

- `first`
- `last`

With the `first` keyword, only the first result will be consumed from the stream.
It can be used in cases when only the first answer is needed or when there cannot be more than one answer.

With the `last` keyword, the whole stream is consumed, and only its last answer is returned.

[#scalar_functions]
=== Scalar functions

Scalar single functions are used to return a single result for one expression: a variable or a function call.
The following example illustrate simple usages of functions for retrieving an `integer`.

[,typeql]
----
include::{page-version}@new_reference::example$tql/schema_statements_functions.tql[tags=fun-single-scalar-return-value]
----

To retrieve the results of such functions calls, the following read query can be used:

[,typeql]
----
include::{page-version}@new_reference::example$tql/read_statements_functions.tql[tags=fun-single-scalar-return-value]
----

=== Tuple functions

include::{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/functions/stream.adoc[tags=tuple-functions-description]

[,typeql]
----
include::{page-version}@new_reference::example$tql/schema_statements_functions.tql[tags=with-fun-defined]
----

To retrieve the results of such functions calls, the following read query can be used:
