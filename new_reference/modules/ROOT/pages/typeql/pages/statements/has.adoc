[,typeql]
----
insert $person has $name;

An attribute can be created in-place by providing its type and value.

[,typeql]
----
insert $person has name "Alice";
----

== Deleting attribute ownership

The `has` keyword is used to remove an attribute from its owner.

[,typeql]
----
delete has $name of $person;
----

== Matching attributes

The `has` keyword can be used to match attributes of an object.

[,typeql]
----
match $person has $name;
----

The attribute type may be provided.

[,typeql]
----
match $person has name $name;
----

The attribute can be matched by attribute type and value instead of binding it to a variable.

[,typeql]
----
match $person has name "Alice";
----

Alternatively, a comparison can be used to constrain the attribute value.

[,typeql]
----
match $person has name < "Bob";
----
