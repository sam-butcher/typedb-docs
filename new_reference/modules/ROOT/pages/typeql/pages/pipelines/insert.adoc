= Insert stage
:page-aliases: {page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/queries/insert.adoc

An insert stage inserts new data into the database.
Insertable data includes instances of types, ownerships of attributes, and role players of relations.

== Syntax

The body of an insert stage is a sequence of insert statements.

// TODO: We actually introduce constructor and constraint syntaxes: https://discord.com/channels/665254494820368395/1329664928390578247/1339995321266081876
All insert statements have the same syntax as their corresponding match statements.

insert <insert-statement> [ <insert-statement> ... ]
----

== Behavior

* xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/statements/isa.adoc[Isa statements] insert new instances of specified types.
Each variable introduced in the insert clause must be accompanied by an explicit `isa` statement.
* xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/statements/has.adoc[Has statements] insert new ownerships of attributes.
If an attribute is provided by value, the attribute type is mandatory.
* xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/statements/links.adoc[Links statements] insert new role players for relations.
Role tags can be omitted if there is only a single role the role player can play.

== Execution

If the insert stage is the first stage in a write pipeline, its body is executed once.
The output stream in that case contains a single row containing the newly inserted concepts.

If the insert stage is preceded by other stages, its body is executed once for each input row.
The output is then a stream of input rows extended with the newly inserted values.

== Validation

Attempting to insert the following fail immediately and terminate the transaction:

* an instance of an xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/annotations/abstract.adoc[abstract] type,
* an ownership or a role player that does not conform to the schema (a player of a relation that cannot relate a role with the specified role name, a player of a type that cannot play the specified role type, an ownership for the owner that cannot own an attribute of the specified type),
* an instance of an attribute type with a value that violates a constraint annotation (xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/annotations/range.adoc[`@range`], xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/annotations/regex.adoc[`@regex`],
xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/annotations/values.adoc[`@values`]),
* an ownership that violates a constraint annotation (xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/annotations/distinct.adoc[`@distinct`], xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/annotations/key.adoc[`@key`],
xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/annotations/unique.adoc[`@unique`]).

NOTE: xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/annotations/card.adoc[Cardinality annotations] are not enforced until the transaction is committed.
