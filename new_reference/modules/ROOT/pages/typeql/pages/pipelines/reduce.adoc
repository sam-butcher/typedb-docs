== Reduce

=== Syntax

[,typeql]
----
reduce <var> = <operator> [ (<var>) ] [ , ... ];
----

TypeQL supports the following reduce operators:

* `count` -- total number of answers, or, when used with a variable, number of distinct values of the variable,
* `max` -- the *maximum* value of the variable,
* `min` -- the *minimum* value of the variable,
* `mean` -- the *arithmetic mean* of the values of the variable,
* `median` -- the *median* value of the variable,
* `std` -- the *sample standard deviation* of the values of the variable,
* `sum` -- the sum of the values of the variable.

=== Examples

Count the number of logins since `<datetime>`:

[,typeql]
----
match
  $user isa user, has last-login >= <datetime>;
reduce $logins = count;
----

Get disk usage statistics of the files:

[,typeql]
----
match
  $file isa file, has size-kb $s;
reduce $total = sum($s), $mean = mean($s), $max = max($s);
----

== Grouping

When `groupby` is used within a reduce, the answer stream is subdivided into groups based on the value of the grouping variable. The
reduction is then performed separately within each such group. The output of a `reduce` with `groupby` is a stream of rows, one for each
value of the grouping variable.

=== Syntax

[,typeql]
----
reduce <var> = <operator> [ (<var>) ] [ , ... ] groupby <var>;
----

=== Example

Get the number of users per country:

[,typeql]
----
match
  $user isa user;
  $country isa country;
  {
    located($user, $country);
  } or {
    located($user, $place);
    located($place, $country);
  };
reduce $logins = count groupby $country;
