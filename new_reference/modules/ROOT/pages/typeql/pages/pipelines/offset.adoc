= Offset operator

The offset operator skips rows until the specified number has been skipped, then produces the remaining rows as normal.

== Syntax

[,typeql]
----
offset <number>;
----

== Example

Retrieve all people employed by the company, sorted by employment start time from earliest to latest.
Skip first 10, then return the following 10.

This can be thought as retrieving the second page with 10 employees per page.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $company isa company, has company-name "<name>";
  employment (employer: $company, employee: $person),
    has start-date $start;
sort $start;
offset 10;
limit 10;
