= Sort operator
:page-aliases: {page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/modifiers/sorting.adoc

The sort operator sorts the input stream based on the variables and their sort order.

NOTE: Sorting requires the server to fetch all results, sort them, then proceed in the pipeline. This may have significant query performance
impact.

== Syntax

The sort direction may be specified explicitly to be ascending (`asc`) or descending (`desc`). The default sort direction when not specified
is ascending.

[,typeql]
----
sort <var> [asc|desc] [ , <var> [asc|desc] ... ];
----

== Example

Retrieve all posts on a given page, sorted from newest to oldest.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $page isa page, has page-id "<page id>";
  $post isa post, has creation-timestamp $created;
  posting (page: $page, post: $post);
sort $created desc;
----
