A datetime literal consists of a date fragment and a time fragment, separated by the character `T`.

The date fragment consists of the following values, separated by a `-`:

* either a four-digit year or a sign with any number of digits for the year (e.g. `+252525` meaning year 252525),
* a two-digit month of the year,
* and a two-digit day of that month.

The time fragment consists of the following values, separated by `:`:

* a two-digit hour between `00` and `24`,
* a two-digit minute between `00` and `59`,
* a two-digit second between `00` and `60` with up to nine digits after the decimal point.
