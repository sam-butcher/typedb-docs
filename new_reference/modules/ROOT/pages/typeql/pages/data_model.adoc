= Data and query model

This page gives a brief technical overview of TypeDB's type system and query model.

In short, TypeDB's data model is based on a *type system* built from two key ingredients:

* a _single-inheritance_ subtyping system, allowing a type to specialize to zero or more subtypes.
* a _trait-based_ reference system, allowing instances to refer to other instances.

TypeDB's query model is tailored to this type system, directly expressing subtyping and references in its query statements, but also  allowing users to chain together queries and data operations into powerful *multi-stage data pipelines* for all types of workloads.

== Type system

=== Data and direct types

All data in TypeDB has a type. Due to subtyping, data may have more than one type (for example, an entity of type `admin` may also be of type `user`). However, all data in TypeDB's type system has a unique unambigous *direct type*.

* For data *instances*, i.e. data stored in the database, the direct type is determined at the time of creation of the data. For example, `insert $x isa admin` will create an entity of direct type `admin`, whereas `insert $x isa user` will create an entity of direct type `user`.
* For data *literals* (like `1`, `1.0`, `true`) the direct type is identified based on syntax: for example `1` will be an `integer`, whereas `1.0` is a `double`. (Note that when working with expressions of a certain type, implicit and explicit casts may be applied.)

[[taxonomy]]
=== Type taxonomy

TypeDB's type system distinguishes types as follows.

* *User-defined types*. Types defined in the schema of the database.
11. *Entity types*, specified using the keyword `entity`.
+
--
Instances of entity types, simply called entities, can be created _indepdently_, i.e., without reference to other data instance.
--
11. *Relation types*, specified using the keyword `relation`, and are required to have at least one *associated role type* specified with the keyword `relates`.
+
--
Instances of relation types may reference (or "link") zero or more data instances for each associated role type, called their *players* of that role (these data instance must have types with corresponding *player trait*).

For example, a friendship relations may link two friends (implemented by, say, two user entities).

Relations without role players will be removed (no "`dangling relations`").
--
11. *Attribute types*, specified using the keyword `attribute`, and required to have an *associated value type* (either structured or primitive) specified with the keyword `value`.
+
--
Instances of attribute types carry an *associated value* of the associated value type. They may also reference other data instances, called their *owners* (these data instances must have direct types with the corresponding *owner trait*). Two attributes are considered equal if they have the same associate value and have the same (origin) type.

Attributes without owners will be removed (no "`dangling attributes`", unless the attribute type is marked as independent).
--
11. *Structured value types*, specified using the keyword `struct` and used in the context of defining attribute types via the keyword `value`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Coming soon.

* *Built-in types* (and type operators).
11. *Primitive value types*, used in the context of defining attribute types via the keyword `value`.
+
--
Two instances of a value type are equal exactly when their literal values are equal (as checked with equality comparison `==`).
--
11. *List types*, used by the syntax `[<T>]` for a non-list type `<T>` (which can be either built-in or user-defined).
+

=== Type traits and "`objects vs attributes`"

Entity types can have traits, i.e. play roles or own attribute types. This allows us to create connections of entities with other data.

Relation types can also have traits, i.e. play roles or own attribute types. This, for example, allows the creation of nested relations (i.e., relations playing roles in other relations).

Since entity and relation types together make up "`first-class`" types in TypeDB's type system (when it comes to type traits) they are, together, also referred to as *object types*, whose instances are data *objects*.

Attributes cannot have traits; they are merely typed associations of values to objects.

=== Subtyping

Entity types, relation types, and attribute types can be defined to subtype other types (which themselves must be, respectively, entity types, relationt types, or attributes types). This allows implicit casting of data instances from the subtype into the supertype.

[[representation]]
=== Internal representation

Types are, in essence, identified by their labels (stored as strings).

Data instances (i.e., entities, relation, are attributes) are stored using database intrinsic represenations called *instance identifiers* (**IID**s) which encodes their direct type. IIDs are usually printed in hexadecimal format: `0x0123...`. For attributes, TypeDB also stored their associated *value*; attributes can be used at query time for comparisons and computations by casting them to their underlying values.

== Definitions

User-defined types, their traits, and their subtyping structure, are created and modified through xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/index.adoc#statements[definition statements] in xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/index.adoc#queries[schema queries].

== Data pipelines

=== Concept rows

A concept row is an association of named variables (the "`column names`") to concepts, i.e., type labels, data instances, or literal values:

.Schematic format of concept rows
----
{ $var_1=concept, $var_2=concept, ..., $var_n }
----
When working with optional variables in data pipelines, concept assignment may be left empty, indicated by `()`, e.g.:

.A concept row with an empty (third) variable
----
{ $var_1=type_label, $var_2=3.1415, $var_3=(), $var_4=0x001 }
----

=== Stages

Data pipelines are chains of *stages*: each stage gets an input stream of concepts row, and outputs itself a stream of concept rows. The first stage in a pipeline gets the *unit row* `{}` as its single input (note: this is _not_ an empty stream).

There are two classes of stages:

* *Stateful* stages, like `match` or `insert`, are stages whose execution results depend on the state of (i.e. the data in) the database.
* *Stateless* stages, like `reduce` or `select`, only depend on the input stream and can thus be executed without querying the database.

[[queries_as_types]]
=== Queries vs types

The `match` stage is the only data pipeline stage which filters and retrieves data using TypeQL patterns: patterns are a direct counterpart to TypeDB's type system and expresses typing and reference constraints of data.

[NOTE]
====
For the curious reader: TypeDB adheres to the principle of "`queries as types`" (an analog of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence[propositions as types]). This means, patterns in `match` stage are really types (of the data that the stage retrieves). For example, a TypeQL conjunction
[,typeql]
----
match
  $field1 isa type1;
  $field2 isa type2;
----
may be thought of as a *struct* (or "`product`") type:
[,rust]
----
struct query_answers {
  field1: type1,
  field2: type2,
}
----
Similarly, a TypeQL disjunction
[,typeql]
----
match
  { $option1 isa type1; }
  or { $option2 isa type2; };
----
may be thought of as a *enum* (or "`sum`") type:
[,rust]
----
enum query_answers {
  option1(type1),
  option2(type2),
}
----
TypeQL's patterns provide an elegant way of producing yet more general composite types in this way.

[[variables]]
== Variables categories

Stages in TypeQL xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/index.adoc#queries[data pipeline] will contain xref:{page-version}@new_reference::typeql/pages/index.adoc#statements[statements] with variables. Any variable in a stage belongs to exactly one of four categories.

1. *Instance variables*, represent data instances from your database. Instance variables are identified by their usage in statements. For example:
+
--
[,typeql]
----
match $someone isa $user;
----
implies that `$someone` isa an instance variable.
--
1. *Value variables*, represent values that are computed as part of your query. Value variables are identified by their usage in statements. For example:
+
--
[,typeql]
----
match let $computed_val = $other_val + 1;
----
implies that `$computed_val` is a value variable.
--
1. *Type variables*, represent type labels. As before, they are identified by their usage in statements. For example:
+
--
[,typeql]
----
match $something isa $type;
----
implies that `$type` is a type variable.
--
1. *List variables*.
+

[[modes]]
== Variable modes

Each variable in a stage can appear in one of the following three modes.

* *Input* (or "`bound`") variables are variables that are bound in a preceding stage. For example,
+
--
[,typeql]
----
match $x isa user, has age 33;
limit 1;
match friendship ($y, $x);  # $x is an input for this stage
----
--
* *Output* variables are unbound variables that are part of the present stage's output (at least in one `or`-branch of the query). For example, in the query
+
--
[,typeql]
----
match
 $x isa user;
 { $x isa VIP; }
 or { $x isa admin, has access-level $lvl; $lvl > 9000; };
----
both `$u` and `$lvl` are returnable variables.

*Optional* variables are a subclass of returnable variables: these or variables that may be left empty in the stages output (you may think of this as assigning them to the unit `()` of the unit type, which is implicit in our type system).
[NOTE]
====
Further optionality features coming soon!
====
--
* *Internal* variables are variables that are not returned by the stage. The prototypical example is a `not` query, like
+
--
[,typeql]
----
match
  $x isa user;
  not { friendship ($x, $y); }
----
where the variable `$y` is internal. The class of internal variable also includes *anonymous* variables (indicated by `$_`).

An important aspect of internal variables is they do not lead to result duplication. For example,
[,typeql]
----
match
  $x isa user;
  friendship ($x, $_);
----
will return exactly the set of users (instead of a copy of the same user for each of their friends).
--

== Functional query model

In many simple cases, TypeQL query semantics can be intuitively understood (see, e.g, the <<queries_as_types,queries as types>> examples above): in essence, a `match` stage outputs *all combinations of data* that satisfy the pattern.

Query semantics become more complicated in the presence of functions, since these can be called in a (mutually) recursive fashion. In this case, we require that:

.Function stratification principle
> If function 1 is called in the body function 2 from within the scope of a negation, then the evaluation of function 1 must be independent of that of function 2 (i.e., there must not be a chain of functions calls that calls function 2 from function 1).

The principle ensure that there is a layering ("`stratification`") of function call evaluation which guarantees queries have well-defined semantics.

[NOTE]
====
Readers familiar with logic programming à la Datalog will recognize the above principle as related to that of *stratified negation*. Indeed, the functional query programming model is a generalization of classical logic programming, replacing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence[propositions with types].
====

== Pipeline evaluation

Data pipelines are evaluated in two stages:

1. *Type inference*. TypeDB will double-check which combinations of types are valid given the constraints in your query. If a non-type variable cannot be assigned a type, the query will fail at this stage with a type inference error.
1. *Stage-by-stage evaluation*. Stage in the data pipeline are evaluated one after the other. In each case, for each output row from the previous stage the present stage, will produce n output rows (n may be zero), and pass each such row, after augmenting it with its own input, as an input row to the next stage.
