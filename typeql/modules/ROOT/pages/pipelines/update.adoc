= Update stage
:page-aliases: {page-version}@typeql::queries/update.adoc

An update stage updates data in the database. Updatable data includes ownerships of attributes and role players of
relations.

== Syntax

The body of an update stage is a sequence of update statements, which are similar to xref:{page-version}@typeql::statements/has.adoc[`has`] and xref:{page-version}@typeql::statements/links.adoc[`links`] statements of xref:{page-version}@typeql::pipelines/insert.adoc[insert].

[,typeql]
----
update <update-statement> [ <update-statement> ... ]
----

== Behavior

* xref:{page-version}@typeql::statements/has.adoc[Has statements] replace existing attribute ownerships of the specified attribute's type (xref:{page-version}@typeql::statements/isa.adoc[`isa!`]) with a new ownership of the specified instance.
If an attribute is provided by value, the attribute type is mandatory.
* xref:{page-version}@typeql::statements/links.adoc[Links statements] replace existing role players of the specified player's role (xref:{page-version}@typeql::statements/isa.adoc[`isa!`]) with the specified instance.
Role tags can be omitted if there is only a single role the role player can play.

Update stages cannot bind new variables.

If there is no data to existing replace, the operation is equivalent to xref:{page-version}@typeql::pipelines/insert.adoc[insert].

== Execution

The update stage must be preceded by other stages. The body of the update stage is executed once for each input row. The output is then a stream equivalent to the input rows, as no variables are modified.

== Validation

Only unambiguous operations on xref:{page-version}@typeql::statements/owns.adoc[`owns`] and xref:{page-version}@typeql::statements/relates.adoc[`relates`] with xref:{page-version}@typeql::annotations/card.adoc[cardinalities] limited by 1 are allowed.

The modified concepts are validated the same way as in xref:{page-version}@typeql::pipelines/insert.adoc#_validation[insert stages].

== Example

[,typeql]
----
match
  $group isa group, has group-id "<group id>";
  $user isa user, has username "<username>";
  $group-membership isa group-membership, has rank "admin", links (member: $user);
update
  $group-membership has rank "member";
  $group-membership links (group: $group);
