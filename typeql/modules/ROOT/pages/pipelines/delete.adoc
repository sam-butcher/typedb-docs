= Delete stage
:page-aliases: {page-version}@typeql::queries/delete.adoc

A delete stage deletes data from the database. Deletable data includes instances of types, ownerships of attributes, and role players of
relations.

== Syntax

The body of a delete stage is a sequence of delete statements.

[,typeql]
----
delete ( <variable> | has <variable> of <variable> | links ( <variable> [ , ... ] ) of <variable> ); [ ... ]
----

== Behavior

* Bare variables delete the instances they refer to from the database. 
* xref:{page-version}@typeql::statements/has.adoc[Delete has statements] delete ownerships of attributes.
* xref:{page-version}@typeql::statements/links.adoc[Delete links statements] delete role players from relations.

== Execution

The delete stage must be preceded by other stages. The body of the delete stage is executed once for each input row. The output is then a
stream of input rows with the deleted concepts removed.

== Example

[,typeql]
----
match
  $person isa person, has name "<name>";
  $group isa group, has group-id "<group id>";
  $membership isa group-membership(group: $group, member: $person) has rank $rank;
  $rank == "member";
delete
  has $rank of $membership;
  links ($person) of $membership;
  $group;
