= Duration

An ISO 8601 compliant duration type. 

== Syntax

A duration literal starts with the character `P` (for _period_) followed by one or more values.
Character `T` separates the date and time portions of the duration literal, similarly to the ISO 8601 datetime format.

Date value unit designators:

* `Y`: years,
* `M`: months,
* `W`: weeks,
* `D`: days.

Time value unit designators:

* `H`: hours,
* `M`: minutes,
* `S`: seconds.

WARNING: As per the standard, weeks cannot be specified alongside other units.

Seconds can be specified as a decimal fraction, with precision up to nanoseconds (9 digits after the decimal point). Values for all other
units are expected to be integers.

----
# 12 weeks
P12W

# 1 year, 2 months, 3 days, 4 hours, 5 minutes, 6 seconds, and 789 milliseconds
P1Y2M3DT4H5M6.789S

# not allowed
# P1W1D

# Even though `M` can mean either months or minutes,
# they are disambiguated by the time designator `T`
P1M # one month
PT1M # one minute
----

== Storage representation

A duration value is stored as three integer parts: 32 bits of months, 32 bits of days, and 64 bits of nanoseconds. In particular, no
conversion between the parts is performed: `P1D` is not always equal to `PT24H`, nor can `P1M` be converted to any fixed number of days
without having a date as a frame of reference.

== In expressions

When adding to or subtracting from a datetime or a datetime-tz value, first the months part is added, then the days, and finally the
nanoseconds. These operations respect daylight saving changes, and other timezone changes where relevant.

[WARNING]
====
This means that addition of durations to datetimes is not commutative.

[,typeql]
----
# 29th of Februrary + 1 month and 1 day = 29th of March + 1 day = 30th of March
2024-02-29T12:00:00 + P1M1D == 2024-02-29T12:00:00 + P1M + P1D == 2024-03-30T12:00:00

# 29th of Februrary + 1 day + 1 month = 1st of March + 1 month = 1st of April
2024-02-29T12:00:00 + P1D + P1M == 2024-04-01T12:00:00
----

To avoid confusion, it is generally recommended to compute the duration value first, then add it to or subtract it from the datetime.
====

If adding a month would make the day of the month invalid, the last day of the resulting month is used instead.

[,typeql]
----
# 31st of January + 1 month = 28th of February, not 31st of February or 3rd of March
2025-01-31T14:00:00Z + P1M == 2025-02-28T14:00:00Z
----

When used with a value of type datetime-tz, arithmetic operations with duration respect local timezone changes (e.g. daylight saving time).

# London DST change occurred on 2024-03-31 01:00:00 GMT
2024-03-30T12:00:00 Europe/London + P1D == 2024-03-31T12:00:00 
2024-03-30T12:00:00 Europe/London + PT24H == 2024-03-31T13:00:00 
----

If adding months and days results in an ambiguous datetime in the time zone, the earlier datetime is used.

[,typeql]
----
# London DST change occurred on 2024-10-27 02:00:00 BST
# I.e., on 2024-10-27, the time span between 01:00:00 and 02:00:00 occurs twice
2024-10-26T01:30:00 Europe/London + P1D == 2024-10-27T01:30:00 BST

# Between these two local datetimes, the earliest is BST
2024-10-26T01:30:00 Europe/London + PT24H == 2024-10-27T01:30:00 BST
2024-10-26T01:30:00 Europe/London + PT25H == 2024-10-27T01:30:00 GMT
----

If adding months and days results in a datetime that does not exist in the time zone, i.e. if there is a gap in the time zone, the datetime
is increased by the length of the gap.

[,typeql]
----
# London DST change occurred on 2024-03-31 01:00:00 GMT
# I.e., there is a gap on 2024-03-31 between 01:00:00 and 02:00:00
2024-03-30T01:30:00 Europe/London + P1D == 2024-03-31T02:30:00 BST

# This is the same as adding 24 hours
2024-03-30T01:30:00 Europe/London + PT24H == 2024-03-31T02:30:00 BST
----

The nanosecond part of the duration is added directly to the underlying UTC timestamp, and as such requires no special handling.
