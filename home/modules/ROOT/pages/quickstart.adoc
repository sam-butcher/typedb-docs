[#_create_free_cluster]
== Create a free cluster

. https://cloud.typedb.com[Create a TypeDB Cloud account]. Your first cluster is free.
. On the *Clusters* dashboard, click *Create cluster*.
. Configure your cluster, then click *Deploy*.

Your cluster will be created in a few seconds and the *Connect to your cluster* dialog will display.


[#_connect_cluster]
== Connect to your cluster

In the *Connect to your cluster* dialog, click *TypeDB Console*. The dialog will contain instructions to install TypeDB Console, which can also be found xref:{page-version}@home::install-tools.adoc[here]. Install TypeDB Console, if you haven't already.

Once your cluster is online, the *Connect to your cluster* dialog will display the
*connection command* for your cluster.

. Copy the connection command and save it in a secure location. You'll need it each time you want to connect to your cluster - specifically, you'll need the generated username and password.
. Simply run the copied command in a terminal window. You'll see a `>` in your terminal. Once this is done, you're ready to begin developing with TypeDB!

[NOTE]
====
You'll be connected as the default database user, which is created with admin privileges.
