= HTTP Endpoint

The TypeDB HTTP endpoint can be used to perform database management, user management, transaction management, and querying operations through HTTP.

== Access the API

=== Base URL

// tag::connect[]
[tabs]
====
Cloud::
+
--
// tag::connect_cloud[]
. In the TypeDB Cloud website, navigate to your cluster and click *Connect*. Then, click *Connect with TypeDB HTTP API*. This will reveal the base URL of the HTTP API.
. You'll need your user credentials, which can be found in your downloaded credentials file (if you have one).
// end::connect_cloud[]
--

Enterprise::
+
--
// tag::connect_enterprise[]
By default, the HTTP endpoint is hosted at port **8000**. This is configurable.

You'll need your user credentials, which will be used to get an authentication token.
// end::connect_enterprise[]
--

Community Edition::
+
--
// tag::connect_ce[]
By default, the HTTP endpoint is hosted at port **8000**, and for local instances you can use `http://localhost:8000`.

You'll need your user credentials, which will be used to get an authentication token.
// end::connect_ce[]
--
====
// end::connect[]

[#_authentication]
=== Authentication

Mostly all methods require Token-based authorization.
These temporary tokens can be generated through a xref:{page-version}@drivers::http/api-reference.adoc#_sign_in[`POST` request to `/v1/signin`].
Provide your TypeDB user credentials in the request's body.

Change the xref:{page-version}@manual::configure/server.adoc#_command_line_arguments[`server.authentication.token_ttl_seconds`] parameter in the server's configuration to modify the time the tokens will remain valid before a new sign in request is required.

=== Encryption

If xref:{page-version}@manual::configure/encryption.adoc[server encryption] is set up, its settings are also applied to the HTTP endpoint, and the endpoint access will be additionally protected.
Visit the xref:{page-version}@manual::configure/server.adoc#_encryption[server configuration] page for more details.

=== CORS

The default permissive (allowing all headers, methods, and origins) CORS layer is set up.

== Set up databases and users

See xref:{page-version}@drivers::http/api-reference.adoc[] to access available database and user management methods.

[#_run_queries]
== Run queries

=== Understanding query answers

The TypeDB HTTP endpoint supports all types of xref:{page-version}@manual::queries/transactions.adoc[transactions] and xref:{page-version}@manual::queries/index.adoc[queries].
The common xref:{page-version}@manual::queries/answers.adoc[query answer type], a list of concept rows, is represented in the HTTP endpoint like the following document:

.Concept rows answer
[%collapsible]
====
Each successful query response contains a query type, an answer type, an optional warning message, and the list of answers containing concepts (if applicable).

The `answers` field contains a list of documents with variables as keys and concepts as values.
Each concept contains a `kind` field for unambiguous parsing.
Each type has a label, and each instance has an optional description of its type, if the specific query option (`includeInstanceTypes`) is enabled.
See all the possible concept variants below.

include::{page-version}@drivers:resources:partial$http-api/responses/query-concept-rows-example.json.adoc[]
====

The result above can be achieved in two different ways.

=== Manual transaction management

This will except you to manually open, close, and commit transactions used for querying.

Open a transaction using a `POST` request `/v1/transactions/open`.
Provide an authorization token in the header (see xref:{page-version}@drivers::http/index.adoc#_authentication[authentication] above) and a JSON body, containing information about the target database and required transaction type:

[source,json]
----
{
    "databaseName": "typedb",
    "transactionType": "read"
}
----

[NOTE]
====
Schema transactions have an exclusive lock on the database and prevent other transactions from opening.
If you don't close a schema transaction and lose its ID, it will be closed automatically based on the transaction timeout specified in the request (this parameter can be added to the request above):

[source,json]
----
"transactionOptions": {
    "transactionTimeoutMillis": <integer>
}
----
====

If everything is correct, you will receive a response containing a body like:

[source,json]
----
{
    "transactionId": "e1f8583c-2a03-4aac-a260-ec186369e86f"
}
----

Then, send a `POST` query request to `v1/transactions/e1f8583c-2a03-4aac-a260-ec186369e86f/query` with the same authorization token in the header and the following JSON body included:

[source,json]
----
{
    "query": "<your TypeQL query>",
    "queryOptions": {
        "includeInstanceTypes": true
    }
}
----

Don't forget to close the transaction when the work is done.

=== One-shot query

To avoid manual transaction management, a one-shot query endpoint can be used.
It opens and automatically closes or commits a transaction for each query sent.

Send a single `POST` request to `/v1/query`.
Provide an authorization token in the header (see xref:{page-version}@drivers::http/index.adoc#_authentication[authentication] above) and the following body containing information about the target database, transaction type required, query, and optional options:

[source,json]
----
{
    "databaseName": "typedb",
    "transactionType": "read",
    "query": "<your TypeQL query>",
    "queryOptions": {
        "includeInstanceTypes": true
    },
    "commit": false
}
----

With this, you don't need to worry about forgotten transactions.

=== Running big queries

The current version of the HTTP endpoint does not support query answer streaming.
Unlike in gRPC, the query results will be fully consumed before an initial answer is received on the client side, and the whole list of concept rows or documents will be returned in a single response.

While this mechanism will be enhanced in the future, for safety purposes, please use a special query option `answerCountLimit` to limit the amount of produced results and avoid too long query execution.
The default value of ten thousand answers can be extended if you are ready for the consequences.

If this limit is hit:

- Read queries will return `206 Partial Content` with all the answers processed;
- Write queries will be fully executed, and their changes can be committed.
The results will be returned with `206 Partial Content`.


For example:

Sending a request to `/v1/transactions/:transaction-id/query` with the following body:

[source,json]
----
{
    "query": "match $p isa person, has $n; delete has $n of $p;",
    "queryOptions": {
        "answerCountLimit": 1
    }
}
----

Can lead to: `400 Bad Request`

[source,json]
----
{
    "code": "HSR13",
    "message": "[TSV17] Write query results limit (1) exceeded, and the transaction is aborted. Retry with an extended limit or break the query into multiple smaller queries to achieve the same result.\n[HSR13] Transaction error."
}
----


== Configuration

TypeDB server offers both a gRPC (standard for most of the client applications) and an HTTP endpoint by default.
Both endpoints have common authentication and xref:{page-version}@manual::configure/encryption.adoc[encryption settings].
Additionally, it is possible to disable the HTTP endpoint and change its default port.

[NOTE]
====
HTTP and gRPC ports must be different.

Please visit xref:{page-version}@manual::configure/server.adoc#_command_line_arguments[Server configuration] for the configuration specification.
