:summary: A simple example with an application using TypeDB Rust driver.
:tabs-sync-option:
:page-preamble-card: 1

In this tutorial, we'll build a sample application with the Rust driver capable of basic interaction with TypeDB:

* Connect to a TypeDB server,
* Manage databases and transactions,
* Send different types of queries.

Follow the steps below or see the
https://github.com/typedb/typedb-docs/tree/3.x-master/drivers/modules/ROOT/partials/tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[full source code,window=_blank].

== Environment setup

To run this sample application, you'll need:

. TypeDB: either a https://cloud.typedb.com/[TypeDB Cloud,window=_blank] cluster or a self-hosted deployment.
For installation instructions, see the xref:{page-version}@manual::install/index.adoc[] page.
. Rust, cargo, and https://crates.io/crates/typedb-driver[TypeDB Rust driver].
For the driver installation instructions, see the xref:{page-version}@drivers::rust/index.adoc[] page.
If you see "unstable features"-related errors while running the example, to update cargo through `rustup update`.

The Sample application below is asynchronous.
Make sure to add the driver crate either in the `Cargo.toml` or via the following command:

[source,console]
----
cargo add typedb-driver
----

Add `-F sync` to the line above if you want to use a sync version of the driver for your applications.

//#todo Consider adding virtualenv step-by-step guide
== Imported modules

To be able to use the TypeDB Rust driver API in the Sample application, use the following import statements:

[,rust,indent=0]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[tag=import]
----

== Default values

We store default values as constants in the source code:

[,rust,indent=0]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[tag=constants]
----

where `DB_NAME` -- the name of the database to use;
`SERVER_ADDR` -- address of the TypeDB server to connect to;
`TYPEDB_EDITION` -- TypeDB Community Edition or Cloud edition selector;
`USERNAME`/`PASSWORD` -- authentication credentials.

== Program structure

The main workflow of this sample application includes establishing a connection to TypeDB, database setup, and querying.

[,rust,indent=0]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[tag=main]
----

The entire `main()` function code is executed in the context of the <<_typedb_connection,network connection>>, represented by the `driver` object that is returned by the function.

[#_typedb_connection]
== TypeDB connection

The `driver_connect()` function takes `edition`, `uri`, and the credentials as mandatory parameters.

[,rust]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[tag=connection]
----

The `edition` is expected to be an Enum for selecting a TypeDB edition.
Depending on the TypeDB edition selected, this function initializes either a TypeDB Community Edition or a TypeDB Cloud / Enterprise connection.

TypeDB connections require objects of the `Credentials` (authentication credentials) and `DriverOptions` (driver-specific connection options like TLS settings) classes.
For our sample application, we have suitable default values set for all editions.

== Database setup

To set up a TypeDB database, we need to make sure that it exists and has the correct schema and data.
First, we check whether a database with the provided name already exists on the server.

If such a database doesn't exist, we <<_creating_a_database,create a new database>>,
<<_defining_a_schema,define its schema>>, and <<_loading_initial_data,load initial data>>.

[NOTE]
====
To prevent data loss, avoid deleting an existing database without confirmation from a user.
====

If a database with the specified name already exists, we check whether we need to replace it.
To do so, we check the `db_reset` parameter, and, if it's `false`, ask for an input from a user.
If any of the two suggesting replacement of the database is acceptable, we replace the database by deleting the existing database and then <<_creating_a_database,creating a new one>>.

As the final step of the database setup, we <<_testing_a_database,test it>>.

[,rust]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[tag=db-setup]
----

[#_creating_a_database]
=== Creating a new database

We create a new database with the specified name (`sample_app_db` by default) and call functions to <<_defining_a_schema,define its schema>> and <<_loading_initial_data,load initial data>>.

[,rust]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[tag=create_new_db]
----

[#_replacing_a_database]
=== Replacing a database

We delete a database with the specified name (`sample_app_db` by default) and call a function to <<_creating_a_database,create a new one>> instead:

[,rust,indent=0]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[tag=replace_db]
----

[#_defining_a_schema]
=== Defining a schema

We use a xref:{page-version}@typeql::schema/define.adoc[define query] to define a schema for the newly created database:

[,rust]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[tag=db-schema-setup]
----

The schema for the sample application is stored in the
https://github.com/typedb/typedb-docs/tree/3.x-master/drivers/modules/ROOT/partials/tutorials/schema.tql[schema.tql,window=_blank]
file.

.See the full schema
[%collapsible]
====
.schema.tql
[,typeql]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/schema.tql[lines=15..]
----
====

We use a database name passed as a parameter to open a transaction.
Then we send the contents of the file as a TypeQL define query and commit the changes made by the transaction.

[#_loading_initial_data]
=== Loading initial data

With the schema defined, we can load initial data into our database with the
xref:{page-version}@typeql::pipelines/insert.adoc[insert query]:

[,rust]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[tag=db-dataset-setup]
----

We read the
https://github.com/typedb/typedb-docs/tree/3.x-master/drivers/modules/ROOT/partials/tutorials/data_small_single_query.tql[data_small_single_query.tql,window=_blank]
file, send its contents as a single query, and then commit the changes.

.See the full insert query
[%collapsible]
====
.data_small_single_query.tql
[,typeql]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/data_small_single_query.tql[lines=15..]
----
====

[#_testing_a_database]
=== Testing a database

With the <<_defining_a_schema,schema defined>> and <<_loading_initial_data,data loaded>>, we test our database to make sure it's ready.
To test the database, we send a query to count the number of users in the database:

[,rust]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[tag=validate-db]
----

== Query examples

After database setup is complete, we proceed with querying our database with different types of queries in the
`queries()` function:

[,rust,indent=0]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[tag=queries]
----

The queries are as follows:

. <<_fetch,Fetch query>> -- to retrieve information in a JSON format
. <<_insert,Insert query>> -- to insert new data into the database
. <<_match,Match query>> -- to retrieve data from the database as rows
. <<_match_function,Match query with a function call>> -- to retrieve data from the database as rows using functions
. <<_update,Update query>> -- to replace data in the database
. <<_delete,Delete query>> -- to delete data from the database

Every query is implemented as a function that includes some output of the query response and returns some meaningful data.

[#_fetch]
=== Fetch query

Fetching allows you to retrieve data from a TypeDB database as JSON documents.

Let's use a xref:{page-version}@typeql::pipelines/fetch.adoc[fetch pipeline] to fetch `phone` s and `email` s for all `user` s in the database:

[,rust]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[tag=fetch]
----

We get the response as a stream of results, containing JSONs (`ConceptDocument` s).
We create a `result` variable to store the results and iterate through stream to print and store JSONs.

//#todo Add printing Names and E-mail from a JSON, add multiple names/e-mails implementation

[#_insert]
=== Insert query

Let's insert a new `user` with `username`, `phone`, and `email` attributes to the database.

[,rust]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[tag=insert]
----

The insert query returns a stream of `ConceptRow` s: one for every `insert` clause execution.
We collect the stream to a vector to store the inserted data.
Then we print `phone` s and `email` s by iterating though the vector of `ConceptRow` s, commit the changes, and return the stored vector.

Since the insert query has no `match` clause, the `insert` clause is executed exactly once.
Insert queries always return `ConceptRow` s, which represent an inserted result: column names (variable names) and their respective concepts.

[#_match]
=== Match query

If we don't need to convert the result into a JSON document, we can use a single xref:{page-version}@typeql::pipelines/match.adoc[match stage], which returns `ConceptRow` s similarly to <<_insert, insert>>.

Let's retrieve all direct relatives for a `user` using its `email`.

[,rust]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[tag=match]
----

The `get_direct_relatives_by_email()` function checks that there is only one `user` matched with the `email` provided by an input parameter.
It then executes the query to find the relatives, collects the results, and iterates through them to print the `username` of every matched relative.

[NOTE]
====
For bigger numbers of results it might be faster to iterate through a stream, rather than collect and store the results first.
====

[#_match_function]
=== Match query with a function call

Let's change the query a little to get not only direct relatives, but all relatives of a `user`.
Additionally, let's use a TypeDB function called `all_relatives` that we previously defined in the schema.

[,rust,indent=0]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[tag=match-function]
----

[#_update]
=== Update query

Let's replace a `phone` of one of the `user` s by a new one.
The fastest way is to use an `update` stage, which replaces the old data with the specified values:

[,rust]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[tag=update]
----

We could also do that by deleting ownership of the old path attribute from the file entity and assigning it with ownership of the new path attribute manually by writing consecutive `delete` and `insert` pipeline stages.

[NOTE]
====
Executing multiple write stages in a single transaction isolates these changes from other transactions: there won't be any point of time for other TypeDB users where they won't see a `user` s `phone`.
Moreover, if any other transaction makes a conflicting change before we commit this transaction, then our transaction fails upon a commit.
====

[#_delete]
=== Delete query

Finally, let's delete a `user` by a given `email`.
It can be simply done by a single statement inside a `match`, and a very short `delete` operation.

[,rust]
----
include::{page-version}@drivers::partial$tutorials/rust/src/main.rs[tag=delete]
