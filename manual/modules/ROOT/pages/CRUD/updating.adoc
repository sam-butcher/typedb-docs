:page-aliases: {page-version}@manual::writing/update.adoc

This page explains how to update data in a TypeDB database.

== Overview

Data in TypeDB is updated using `update` or a combination of `delete` and `insert` stages in *write pipelines*, which can executed in `write` (or `schema`) xref:{page-version}@manual::queries/transactions.adoc[transactions].
It can be used in a xref:{page-version}@typeql::pipelines/index.adoc[pipeline] to operate variables declared on a preceding stage.

Due to safety reasons, only unambiguous statements are allowed in update stages.
Thus, it can only operate on `has` and `links` statements with their schema xref:{page-version}@typeql::annotations/card.adoc[cardinalities] limited by 1. To have more available actions and manual control over updates, use xref:{page-version}@manual::CRUD/deleting.adoc[deletion] and xref:{page-version}@manual::CRUD/inserting.adoc[insertion] instead.

Update queries replaces the existing data with the values specified.
The new data insertion happens even if no data existed before the update.

This way, update stages can be used to ensure that the data is in a required state before proceeding with other pipeline stages, ignoring the previous "wrong" state of the database.

Refer to the xref:{page-version}@typeql::pipelines/update.adoc[] page for a detailed explanation and additional examples.

== Running updates

To update data, open a `write` xref:{page-version}@manual::queries/transactions.adoc[transaction].
This allows you to read and write data to your database while keeping the schema secure.

Update stages begin with the keyword `update`.
Multiple statements can be combined within the same `update` stage and the same variable may appear in multiple statements.

== Update statements

Let's give a brief overview of what kinds of statements can be used in an update stage.

[[has]]
=== Updating attribute ownerships with `has`

Connections of attributes to their "`owner`" data instances can be updated using `has` statements.

[,typeql]
.Updating a single user's username using a value constant
----
match
  $x isa user, has username "User_1";
update
  $x has username "User_2";
----

[NOTE]
====
If the `username` attribute `"User_2"` does not yet exist when running the above, it will be created anonymously by the above query ("`anonymously`" meaning that we do not assign it to any variable).
However, no explicit `isa` statements for variable binding are allowed in updates.
====

Similarly, an attribute variable can be used in this operation.

[,typeql]
.Updating a single user's username using an attribute variable
----
match
  $x isa user, has username "User_1";
  $y isa username "User_2";
update
  $x has $y;
----

Without update stages, you'd be required to write two other stages instead.

[,typeql]
.Updating a single user's username through delete and insert
----
match
  $y isa username "User_2";
  $y-old isa username "User_1";
  $x isa user, has $y-old;
delete
  has $y-old of $x;
insert
  $x has $y;
----

[[links]]
=== Updating role players with `links`

Connections of relations to their "`role players`" data instances can be updated using `links` statements.

[,typeql]
.Updating all existing group memberships of a user with a new group
----
insert
  $g isa group, has group-id "Group_2";
match
  $x isa user, has username "User";
  $gm isa group-membership, links (member: $x);
update
  $gm links (group: $g);
----

If a role player can only play a single role in the relation, the role can be omitted.

[,typeql]
.Updating all existing group memberships of a user with a new group without updated role specification
----
insert
  $g isa group, has group-id "Group_2";
match
  $x isa user, has username "User";
  $gm isa group-membership, links (member: $x);
update
  $gm links ($g);
----

As already mentioned, update stages are useful to write shorter queries.
It is especially noticeable in queries updating multiple things.
For example, swapping role players after a mistaken insertion.

[,typeql]
.Using an update stage to swap role players
----
match
  $p isa parentship (parent: $x, child: $y);
update
  $p links (parent: $y, child: $x);
----

== Update stage answers

An update stage does not modify the input variables from the previous stages.
Thus, it returns a stream of the same concept rows produced by a preceding pipeline stage.

.Update example's result
[,typeql]
----
   ------------
    $g  | iid 0x1f00020000000000000001 isa group
    $gm | iid 0x1e00030000000000000000 isa group-membership
    $x  | iid 0x1e00030000000000000003 isa user
   ------------
