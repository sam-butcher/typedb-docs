= Inserting data
:page-aliases: {page-version}@manual::writing/insert.adoc

This page explains how to insert data in a TypeDB database.

== Overview

Data in TypeDB is inserted using `insert` stages in *write pipelines*, which can executed in `write` (or `schema`) xref:{page-version}@manual::queries/transactions.adoc[transactions].

Inserts can be performed as part of a single-stage query, in which case the data insert will occur exactly once. Inserts can also be part of multi-stage a xref:{page-version}@typeql::pipelines/index.adoc[pipelines], potentially with multiple input rows from the preceding stage (e.g., a xref:{page-version}@typeql::pipelines/match.adoc[`match` stage]), in which case we perform one data insert for each input row.

Refer to the xref:{page-version}@typeql::pipelines/insert.adoc[] page for a detailed explanation and additional examples.

== Running inserts

To insert data, open a `write` xref:{page-version}@manual::queries/transactions.adoc[transaction].
This allows you to read and write data to your database while keeping the schema secure.

Insert stages begin with the keyword `insert`.
Multiple statements can be combined within the same `insert` stage and the same variable may appear in multiple statements (but the variable will refer to the same data in all those statements).

== Insert statements

Let's give a brief overview of what kinds of statements can be used in an insert stage.

[[isa]]
=== Inserting instances with `isa`

To create new data instances we can use `isa` statements. The following simple query creates a new data instance of type `user`:

[,typeql]
.Inserting a user entity
----
insert $x isa user;
----

We may also create relations:

[,typeql]
.Inserting a friendship relation (without role players)
----
insert $f isa friendship;
----
Note, to persist in the database, a relation would need at least one role player (see <<links,player insertion>> below).

Similarly, attributes can only be created using `isa` independently of owners when marked as `@independent` in the schema.

[[has]]
=== Inserting attribute ownerships with `has`

Connections of attributes to their "`owner`" data instances can be inserted using `has` statements.

[,typeql]
.Inserting a single user and a username for that user
----
insert
  $x isa user;
  $x has username "User";
----

This can be further shortened to:

[,typeql]
.Inserting a single user together with their username
----
insert
  $x isa user, has username "User";
----

[NOTE]
====
If the `username` attribute `"User"` does not yet exist when running the above, it will be created anonymously by the above query ("`anonymously`" meaning that we do not assign it to any variable). No `isa` statement is required!
====

[[links]]
=== Inserting role players with `links`

Connections of relations to their "`role players`" data instances can be created using `links` statements.

[,typeql]
.Inserting users, a friendship, and links between users via that friendship
----
insert
  $x isa user, has username "User_1";
  $y isa user, has username "User_2";
  $f isa friendship;
  $f links (friend: $x, friend: $y);
----

The last line can be further shortened to:

[,typeql]
.Relation constructor syntax
----
  $f isa friendship (friend: $x, friend: $y);
----

We can even keep the friendship instance anonymous (i.e., not assign it to a variable) if we do not need it otherwise, by simply writing:

[,typeql]
.Anonymous relation constructor syntax
----
  friendship (friend: $x, friend: $y);
----

== Inserting with data pipelines

Most commonly, `insert` stages are use as part of data pipelines. This let's us first retrieve specific data, which we can then augment with new data.

.Match-insert pipeline example
[,typeql]
----
include::{page-version}@manual::example$tql/match_insert_data.tql[tags=simple-match-insert]
----

The first stage of the pipeline retrieves the users called `"Bob"` from the database. For each answer of the first stage, the second stage is then executed: this inserts a new user called `"Charlie"`

See the xref:{page-version}@typeql::pipelines/index.adoc[data pipeline reference] for more information.

== Insert stage answers

An insert stage returns all concepts inserted into the database as a stream of concept rows.
A collected stream of concept rows can be interpreted as a table with a header containing variables and rows with respective concept answers for each variable.
This lets you verify if the result meets your expectations.

For example, the following is a snapshot of a TypeDB Console's response to the <<match_insert, previous query>> (`iid` s may vary):

.Match-insert example's result
[,typeql]
----
   ------------
    $f     | iid 0x1f00020000000000000001 isa friendship
    $new-u | iid 0x1e00030000000000000003 isa user
    $u     | iid 0x1e00030000000000000000 isa user
   ------------

== Committing changes
// tag::preserving-reverting-changes[]
Do not forget to **commit** your transaction to preserve the changes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some data constraints are only validated upon commit.
This means you might discover inconsistencies in your data during the commit process, and the commit will be rejected.

While most validations occur during operation time to keep data synchronized, commit-time validations are necessary to allow flexible data modifications.
For example, validating inserted data against xref:{page-version}@typeql::annotations/card.adoc[cardinality] during operation time could block modifications entirely.
====

If you want to abort your changes, simply close the transaction or perform a rollback.
Refer to xref:{page-version}@manual::queries/transactions.adoc[] for more details.
