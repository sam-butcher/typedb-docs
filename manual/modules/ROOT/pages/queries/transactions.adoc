== Transactionality

TypeDB transactions come in 3 flavors: *read*, *write*, and *schema* transactions.
All transactions operate over *snapshots* of the database, providing a consistent view regardless of the operations performed in concurrent transactions.

TypeDB transactions provide *ACID guarantees* up to snapshot isolation.

All transactions that can do writes in TypeDB are __stateful__: queries that mutate the schema or data have their changes buffered and are accessible to following queries in the transaction.
After a commit, the changes are merged into the global database state and made accessibly to new transactions.

== Read transactions

Read transactions can execute only read queries, and will error when provided data update queries or schema mutation queries.

* They are the most lightweight and should be used whenever possible.
* *Any number of read transactions can be opened concurrently*, and they will never fail to open even when write or schema transactions are open.

== Write transactions

Write transactions can execute read queries and data update queries, and will error when provided schema mutation queries.

* Write transactions can be opened concurrently to other write transactions and read transactions.
* Write transactions *may fail on commit*, as required to enforce data consistency and isolation, such as when two write transactions concurrently update same piece of data and commit.

.Example of conflicting writes
[caption=""]
====
1. We open transaction 1 and modify the owned attribute of an entity.

2. We then open transaction 2 before transaction 1 has been committed, and modify the same ownership.

3. If we commit first transaction 1, then transaction 2, the commit of transaction 2 will fail.
====

== Schema transactions

Schema transactions can execute any type of query: read, data update, and schema mutation queries.
They thus _subsume_ the previous two transaction types.

* Schema transactions are *exclusive* both against other schema transactions and write transactions.
Existing open write transactions will block schema transactions from opening.
Similarly, a schema transaction will block write transactions from opening.
This prevents the data from mutating while the schema is being updated.

* Schema transactions can *mutate both data and schema* at the same time, allowing atomic migrations from one database state to another.

== Executing queries in transaction

All transactions types have an identical API to submit queries.

====
Studio::
+
--
Select your database using the database selector (image:{page-component-version}@home::studio-icons/database-none.png[width=128]), then select your transaction type in the top menu.

Open your query file.
Run the query by clicking the image:{page-version}@home::studio-icons/svg/studio_run.svg[width=24] btn:[Run Query] button.
Finally, use the commit button (image:{page-version}@home::studio-icons/svg/studio_check.svg[width=24]) to persist any changes made.
--

Console::
+
--
Open the transaction with

----
transaction <TYPE> my-db
----

where `<TYPE>` can be one of `schema`, `write`, or `read`.

Then run your queries in the newly opened prompt, using enters for newlines and double enters for query submissions.
Use

----
commit
----

if you want to commit changes, or press kbd:[Ctrl+C] (interrupt) or kbd:[Ctrl+D] (end of input) to terminate the transaction without committing.
--

Python::
+
--
Open a transaction and send a query with

[,python,indent=0]
----
with driver.transaction(<DATABASE NAME>, TransactionType.<TYPE>) as transaction:
    answer = transaction.query(<QUERY>).resolve()
----

where:

- `<QUERY>` and `<DATABASE NAME>` are `str` s.
- `<TYPE>` can be one of `SCHEMA`, `WRITE`, or `READ`.

Use

[,python,indent=0]
----
transaction.commit()
----

if you want to commit changes.
--

Rust::
+
--
Open a transaction and send a query with

[,rust,indent=0]
----
let transaction = driver.transaction(<DATABASE NAME>, TransactionType::<TYPE>).await.unwrap();
{
    let answer = transaction.query(<QUERY>).await.unwrap();
}
----

where:

- `<QUERY>` and `<DATABASE NAME>` are `&str` s.
- `<TYPE>` can be one of `Schema`, `Write`, or `Read`.

Use

[,rust,indent=0]
----
    transaction.commit().await.unwrap();
----

if you want to commit changes.
--

Java::
+
--
Open a transaction and send a query with

[,java,indent=0]
----
 try (TypeDBTransaction transaction = session.transaction(<DATABASE NAME>, Transaction.Type.<TYPE>)) {
     transaction.query(<QUERY>).resolve();
 }
----

where:

- `<QUERY>` and `<DATABASE NAME>` are `String` s.
- `<TYPE>` can be one of `SCHEMA`, `WRITE`, or `READ`.

Use

[,java,indent=0]
----
transaction.commit();
----

if you want to commit changes.

[#_transaction_options]
== Transaction options

When a transaction is opened, its behavior can be additionally configured through xref:{page-version}@drivers::index.adoc[TypeDB Drivers] using transaction options.

Refer to the specific driver's documentation to access the list of available transaction options.
Some of the options may not be available or relevant for a driver or a tool (TypeDB Console and TypeDB Studio).

Use the table below to access the full specification and the option values used by default.

[#_query_options]
== Query options

Similarly, queries have their own options that can replace the default query behaviour.

Refer to the specific driver's documentation to access the list of available query options.
Some of the options may not be available or relevant for a driver or a tool (TypeDB Console and TypeDB Studio).

Use the table below to access the full specification and the option values used by default.
