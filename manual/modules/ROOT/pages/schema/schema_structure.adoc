This page covers the most important aspects of TypeDB schemas.

== Overview

In TypeDB, data is stored in types. There are three kinds of types that exhibit three different, fundamental behaviors of data:

1. Entity types store data instances (simply called *entities*) that can be inserted independently of any other data. For example, a new `user` entity may be created at any point.
1. Relation types store data instances (simply called *relations*) that reference, and thereby _connect_, other data instance (called *role players* in a relation). For example, a new `friendship` relation may be created only with reference to, say, two users acting as friends in that relation.
1. Attribute types store data instances (simply called *attributes*) that are associated with a literal value (e.g., a `string`, `integer`, etc.). Attributes, by default, also must reference a single data instance (called the *owner*) unless the type is annotated as "`independent`".

Data instances in TypeDB adhere to the common programming principle that "`references cannot outlive the data that they point to`":

* Relations will be removed if their role players are removed (more precisely, if the number of role players falls below what is allowed by the schema).
* Attributes will be removed if their owners are removed (expect the case of independent attributes mentioned above).

The logical dependency of data is a guiding principle in TypeDB schema design. However, there are various means of modifying it (e.g., by allowing attributes to be independent, or by enforcing attributes and relations to act as "`keys`" for other data).

[NOTE]
====
For the curious reader: there is no concept of an "`independent`" relation as this is, in essence, the concept of an entity.

== Type traits
//!program[lang=tql, type=schema]

=== Role player traits

Relations organize their set of role players by so-called *role types* (also simply called "`roles`"): each role player is of a specific role type. _But which types of data instances are allowed in the roles of a relation?_

*  We can specify that a type has a *player* trait (for a specific role of a relation type) in the schema. For example,
+
--
//!++
[,typeql]
.Specify that users can act as friends
----
define user plays friendship:friend;
----
////
entity user;
relation friendship, relates friend @card(2);
////
//!--
which literally means that users can act as friends in friendship relations.
--

=== Ownership traits

We can similarly ask for attributes: _which data instances can act as owners of attributes of a given type?_

* We can specify that a type has an *owner* trait (for a specific attributes) in the schema. For example,
+
--
//!++
[,typeql]
.Specify that users can act as username owners
----
define user owns username;
----
////
attribute username, value string;
////
//!--
which literally means that users can act as owners of username attributes.
--

[NOTE]
====
It is important to highlight that multiple different types can have the same trait. For example, both users and bots could plays the role of friends and/or own usernames.

In terms of programming principles, you can understand having traits as database analog of implementing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_(computer_programming)[traits]: like types, traits organize data instances into subcollections; unlike types, you cannot directly instantiate a trait.
====

=== Only object types have traits

Not all types kinds are created equal:

* Entity and relations types (together also referred to as *object* types) _can have traits_.
* Attribute types are considered mere association of values to objects: they _cannot have traits_

== Subtyping and inheritance

A key ingredient of any modern type system is *subtyping*, i.e., the ability to cast instances from one type into another. Subtyping is a key feature of schema modeling in TypeDB: it allows us to specialize and hierarchically organize types and their data instance. For example,
//!++
[,typeql]
.Create an entity type `admin` as a subtype of `user`
----
define entity admin sub user;
----
//!--

Subtyping behaves exactly as expected:

* If we were to query for user instances, we would also find all admin instances
* If we were to query for admin instance, we would not find those users that are not admins.

[NOTE]
====
Subtyping hierarchies in TypeDB are "`single-inheritance`", i.e., every type has a single direct supertype. This choice simplifies data models and avoids the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem[diamond problem].

To model "`non-tree-like`" hierarchies you can exploit the trait system of TypeDB.
====

An important aspect of subtyping is the *inheritance* of traits. In general, _all_ traits of the supertype are inherited by the subtype. However, further traits may be specified for the subtype that are not shared with the supertype. For example,
//!++
[,typeql]
----
define admin owns access-level;
----
////
attribute access-level, value integer;
////
//!--

There _are_ ways to hide supertype traits from subtypes, by setting these traits to be xref:{page-version}@typeql::annotations/abstract.adoc[abstract] (coming soon).
