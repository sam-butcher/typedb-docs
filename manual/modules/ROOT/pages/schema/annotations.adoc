= Defining annotations
:test-tql: linear

This page explains how to use define queries to define annotations for types and type traits.

== Overview
//!program[lang=tql, type=schema]

Annotations define constraints and specialized behavior for types and their traits, enabling more precise control over how data must behave in your database.

[#_type_schema]
.Example schema
[%collapsible]
====
As an example, consider the following schema
//!++
[,typeql]
----
define
  entity content owns id;
  entity page sub content,
    owns page-id,
    owns name;
  entity profile sub page,
    owns username;
  entity user sub profile,
    owns email,
    owns phone,
    owns language,
    owns karma;

  attribute id value string;
  attribute page-id sub id;
  attribute username sub page-id;
  attribute name value string;
  attribute email value string;
  attribute phone value string;
  attribute language value string;
  attribute karma value double;
----
//!--
====

In the schema above we may have the following:

- We may have general `content` data objects side by side with more specialized `page` s, `profile` s, and `user` s.
- `id` s can be duplicated, i.e. need not be unique per content.
- There can be any number of `name` s for a `page` and, thus, a `user`.
- `phone` and `email` values do not adhere to specific formats.
- ...

None of these behaviors may be desirable. TypeDB addresses the issue through a unified annotation mechanism. Annotation, prefixed with `@`, can be *added to schema definition* statements like the ones above. The following list summarizes some of the most common  annotations:

- `@key` ensures attributes act as keys to data. E.g.
+
--
//!++
////
define
////
[,typeql]
----
content owns id @key;
----
//!--
--
- `@regex` enforces string values to adhere to specific regular expressions. E.g.,
+
--
//!++
////
define
////
[,typeql]
----
user owns phone @regex("^\d{8,15}$");
----
//!--
--
- `@unique` enforce attributes uniquely identify their owner. E.g.,
+
--
//!++
////
define
////
[,typeql]
----
user owns phone @unique;
----
//!--
--
- `@card` restricts cardinality, i.e., the number of data instances allowed in a specific context. E.g.,
+
--
//!++
////
define
////
[,typeql]
----
profile owns username @card(1..1);
----
//!--
--
- `@abstract` disallows inserting data instances into types. E.g.,
+
--
//!++
////
define
////
[,typeql]
----
content @abstract;
----
//!--
--
- `@independent` allows storing attributes without owners. E.g.
+
--
//!++
////
define
////
[,typeql]
----
attribute language @independent;
----
//!--
--

== Annotation semantics

[#default_constraints]
=== Default behaviors

Schema definitions may have default behavior if no annotation is specified.

* Role player references of relation types default to `@card(0..1)` behavior (a relation may link 0 or 1 role player).
* Role player traits of other types default to `@card(0..)` behavior (an object may play a specific role in 0 or more relations).
* Attribute ownership traits of  default to `@card(0..1)` behavior (an object may own a specific attribute 0 or 1 times).

See xref:{page-version}@typeql::annotations/card.adoc[@card annotation] for more details.

[#overriding_constraints]
=== Redefining constraints

A single declaration *cannot have multiple different annotations* of the same kind. For example:

* `<statement> @card(X) @card(X) @card(X)` will always result in `type @card(X)`.
* `<statement> @card(X) @card(Y)` is an invalid definition.

A defined annotations whose value should be changed can be xref:{page-version}@typeql::schema/redefine.adoc[redefined].

[NOTE]
====
Constraints and annotations can also be <<combining_constraints, combined>> as a result of subtyping and specialization.
====

[#combining_constraints]
=== Combining annotations

Constraints in TypeDB are cumulative, meaning that every constraint must be respected simultaneously.
Constraints defined through annotations do not relax or interact with one another in a way that reduces their enforcement.

== Subtyping

Subtyping is a powerful instrument in TypeDB and becomes even more powerful with annotations. As a general rule, subtypes inherit the behavior of their supertypes, but they may further specialize this behavior (e.g., through additional annotations).

See the xref:{page-version}@typeql::annotations/index.adoc[annotation reference] for further details.

== Default behaviors

*<<default_constraints>> are implicitly set for defined traits whenever there is no explicitly defined constraint*

E.g., the <<annotations_constraints, following schema>> requires `@card(0..)` specification for `page owns name`, because the default cardinality would not allow `page` s and, thus, `profile` s to have 2 or 3 `name` s.

At the same time, `user` s will only have two cardinality constraints for their names: `0..` and `0..3` as the ownership is inherited.
However, if you were to set a `user owns name` again, a default cardinality constraint would be generated for this ownership, and `user` would need to comply to three cardinality constraints for `name` s.

//!program[lang=tql, type=schema]
//!++
[,typeql]
----
define
  entity page sub content, owns name @card(0..);
  entity profile sub page, owns name @card(0..3);
  entity user sub profile;
----
