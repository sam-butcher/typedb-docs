[#_connect_to_typedb]
== Connect to TypeDB

TypeDB Console can connect to TypeDB CE, TypeDB Cloud instances, or TypeDB Enterprise deployments.
Running TypeDB Console initiates a network connection to a TypeDB server.

// tag::connect_console[]
.Connect to TypeDB
[source,console]
----
typedb console --address=<server-address> --username=<username>
----

You will be prompted for a password.
// end::connect_console[]
// tag::tls_disabled_notice[]

Use `--tls-disabled` to connect to a server without encryption.
// end::tls_disabled_notice[]

[NOTE]
=====
The default username and password are `admin` and `password`.
After connecting for the first time, you will be able to xref:{page-version}@manual::configuring/users.adoc#_first_login[change the password].
=====

As a result, you get a welcome message from TypeDB Console followed by a command line prompt.

----
Welcome to TypeDB Console.

>>
----

See full list of available CLI arguments in the <<_command_line_arguments>> reference section below.

[#_REPL]
== Interactive mode

TypeDB Console provides two levels of interaction via Read–eval–print loop (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop[REPL,window=_blank]):
Server level and Transaction level.

At any level you can use common commands: `help`, `clear`, `exit`.

[#_server_level]
=== Server level

Server level is the first level of interaction, i.e., *first-level REPL*.
From this level, you can use commands for managing databases and users on the server.
You also can open a transaction to a database, which gets you to the <<_transaction_level,second level of REPL>>.

For a full list of commands on the Server level, see the <<_server_level_commands>> section.

[#_transaction_level]
=== Transaction level

Transaction level is the second level of interaction, i.e., *second-level REPL*.
You can control a transaction and send queries in the transaction.

For a full list of commands on the Transaction level, see the <<_transaction_level>> reference section.

[NOTE]
====
To send a query, while in Transaction level, type in or insert a TypeQL query and push btn:[Enter] twice.
====

[WARNING]
====
As of version 3.1.0, the command to open a transaction differs:

The new command, as of version 3.1.0:

[source]
----
>> transaction read sample_db
----

Previously, before version 3.1.0:

[source]
----
>> transaction sample_db read
----
====

When opening a transaction, you can specify transaction options.
For a full list of transaction options, see the <<_transaction_options>>.

[#_interactive_mode_example]
=== Example

The following example illustrates how to create a database, define a schema, and insert some data into the database.

. Run Console in the interactive mode and <<_connect_to_typedb,connect>> it to TypeDB:
+
[source,bash]
----
typedb console --address=<server-address> --username=<username>
----

. Now, run the following command to create a database:
+
----
database create sample_db
----

. To define a schema, run the `transaction` command to open a `schema` transaction to the database.
This command opens a Transaction level REPL.
Use it to send a define query and commit changes:
+
----
transaction schema sample_db
define entity user;

commit
----

+
To send a query in the Transaction level, push btn:[Enter] *twice*, as a single push of the btn:[Enter] is recognized as a line break in the query.

. Insert data with a `write` transaction:
+
----
transaction write sample_db
insert $u isa user;

commit
----

The above example creates a database with the name `sample_db`, defines a simple schema with a single `user` type, then inserts a single instance of the type into the database.

Pasting a block of console commands together is also possible, and equivalent to submitting a script to the console at that point.
This is particularly useful when document examples with self-contained transaction operations, and schema and data queries.

[#_non_interactive_mode]
== Non-interactive mode

You can run Console commands using the `--command` argument:

[,bash]
[source,bash]
----
typedb console --command=<command1> --command=<command2>
----

[#_command_argument_example]
The following example achieves the same results as the <<_interactive_mode_example,one in the interactive mode>>
via the command line arguments.
Run the following command in a terminal to start TypeDB and execute queries:

[,bash]
[source,bash]
----
typedb console --address=<server-address> --username=<username> \
--command="database create sample_db" \
--command="database list" \
--command="transaction schema sample_db" \
--command="define entity user;" \
--command="commit" \
--command="transaction write sample_db" \
--command='insert $u isa user;' \
--command="commit"
----

====

== Scripting

You can create a script file that contains the list of commands to run.
These are the very same commands that are used in the <<_REPL>> or <<_non_interactive_mode>>.
For the full list of commands, see the <<_references>> below.

To use a script file with commands, run Console with the `--script` argument and a path to the script file:

[source,bash]
----
typedb console --script=<script-file-path>
----

By convention, console __**s**__cripts, which can manipulate transactions and server state, use the `.tqls` extension.
In contrast, files containing only TypeQL queries normally use the `.tql` extension.

[NOTE]
====
Scripts use the exact same format as the interactive REPL.
This means queries in the script must be terminated with an empty newline.
====

[#_script_example]
Prepare the script to run and save it to a local file.
For example, let's try the following `script.tqls` file:

.script.tqls
----
database create test
transaction schema test
    define
      entity user owns name;
      attribute name value string;

    commit
transaction write test
    insert $u isa user, has name "Bob";

    commit
transaction read test
    match $u isa user, has name $n; select $n;

    close
database delete test
----

Execute the script with TypeDB Console non-interactively:

.Run script.tqls
[source,bash]
----
typedb console --username=<username> --password=<password> --script=<PATH/script.tqls>
----

Where `<PATH/script.tqls>` is the path to the file and the filename.

.See the output

[#_run_a_query_from_a_file]
== Run query(ies) from a file

To run a series of TypeQL queries stored in a file from _within_ a REPL, use the `source <filename>` command.
Each query should be separated with an empty newline.
Note that this means long queries cannot be split over multiple lines containing empty lines.
Use comments instead.

This command is available from the <<_transaction_level>> REPL:

.Interactive mode source usage example
----
transaction schema sample_db
source schema.tql
commit
----

The `schema.tql` file should be located in the working directory or be an absolute path.

=== Combining scripts and query files

Let's use a script file to:

* Create the `sample_db` database
* Load the schema form the xref:schema-include[schema.tql,window=_blank] file in a schema transaction
* Load sample data from the xref:data-include[data.tql,window=_blank] file in a write transaction
* Run a match-fetch query
* Delete the database to reset the environment

.Script file
----
database create sample_db
transaction schema sample_db
    source schema.tql
    commit
transaction write sample_db
    source data.tql
    commit
transaction read sample_db
    match $u isa user; fetch { "user": { $u.* } };

    close
database delete sample_db

== Troubleshooting

=== Non-ASCII characters

TypeDB can use type and variable labels and store string value attributes that have characters outside the
https://ascii.cl/[ASCII,window=_blank] range, for example, non-English letters, symbols, and emojis.
To manipulate them using Console, the Console's terminal must use a locale with a compatible code set, such as Unicode.

If it doesn't, these characters will most likely be rendered as `?` symbols in Console.
If this issue occurs, you can use the following fix:

[tab:Linux]
[tabs]
====
Linux::
+
--
Use `locale -a` to list all installed locales, and use `export` to set the environment.
For example, to use `en_US.UTF-8` run:

[source,bash]
----
bash export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 && export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
----
--

macOS::
+
--
Use `locale -a` to list all installed locales, and use `export` to set the environment.
For example, to use `en_US.UTF-8` run:

[source,bash]
----
bash export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 && export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
----
--

Windows::
+
--
Use https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-gb&gl=GB[Windows Terminal,window=_blank]
or run https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/chcp[chcp,window=_blank] in the terminal (e.g., `chcp 936` for Chinese text).
--
====

Most systems also allow us to set the system-wide locale.
However, this impacts the appearance of other applications.
