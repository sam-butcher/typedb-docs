= Drivers

A TypeDB driver is a (language-specific) library that allows your application to connect to and query a TypeDB server instance.

Drivers are available for many popular programming languages, such as Python, Java, Rust, and many others.

Additionally, an HTTP API is available for alternative languages and tools (e.g., `curl`).
