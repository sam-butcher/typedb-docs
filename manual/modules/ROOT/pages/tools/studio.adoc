[#_select_database]
=== Select a database

To select a database to work with, use the dropdown menu on the right of the database icon in the top toolbar. You can also create new databases here.

TypeDB Studio will automatically select a *default* database if there are no others present.

== Querying

You can run queries against the connected TypeDB server using TypeDB Studio's https://studio.typedb.com/query[query tool].

[#_write_a_query]
=== Write a query

You can write TypeQL queries in the Query pane.

The Query pane contains a code editor that offers TypeQL highlighting and simple autocompletion.

[#_run_a_query]
=== Run a query

When your query is ready to run, hit "Run query" in the Query pane.

Results are printed to the Run pane.

[#_results]
=== Query results

The Run pane offers three different views of results - you can choose between *Log*, *Table* and *Raw*.

The Log contains textual output, similar to xref:{page-version}@manual::console.adoc[TypeDB Console], as well as input log, and error messages.

Table view is well suited for visualising the answers of *match* and *fetch* queries in a tabular format, where each row represents an answer, and each column represents a variable.

Raw output allows you to see the raw HTTP response from TypeDB.

[#_history_]
=== History pane

All queries and transaction operations are timestamped and logged to the History pane. Any errors that occur can be retrieved from this pane.

[#_transaction_control]
=== Transaction controls

By default, transactions are fully managed by TypeDB Studio. A transaction opens when you start running a query, and commits when a schema/write query is done or closes when a read query is done.

For more fine-grained control, you can use the top bar to change the transaction mode from *auto* to *manual*. This allows you to open transactions, and perform multiple queries within a transaction before closing or committing.

Only one transaction can be open concurrently within a single instance of TypeDB Studio.

[#_connection_management]
=== Connection management

To connect, disconnect, or change connection settings, use the connection button in the top bar.
While connected to TypeDB, the button changes its label to the server's address or the custom name provided when setting up the connection.

[#_error_handling]
=== Error handling

Query-level errors are printed to Log Output. These are typically errors returned directly from TypeDB, and will contain detailed error codes and explanations of the problem (e.g: illegal TypeQL semantics)

Transaction-level errors will trigger an error popup notification.

Both types of errors can be viewed and copied to the clipboard by visiting the History pane on the Query page.

// [#_types_browser_traits]
// == Type Browser
//
// image::{page-version}@drivers::studio/type-browser.png[Type browser, role=right framed, width=50%, link=self]
//
// Type Browser panel gives you a full overview of the type hierarchy for the currently selected database.
//
// In an empty database, there are only three xref:{page-version}@typeql::concepts/types.adoc#_type_hierarchy[root types] shown in the panel.
//
// In a database with a schema,
// all types displayed in the exact hierarchy they were created (subtypes inside their supertypes).
//
// Double-clicking on any type opens the <<_type_editor,Type Editor>> window with information about the selected type.
//
// === Export schema
//
// You can export all type definitions of a schema by clicking the btn:[Export Schema Types]
// button on the top of the *Type Browser* panel.
// Exporting rules is not supported by this button yet.
//
// The button creates a new tab with inserted TypeQL Define query that creates the schema of the database.

// [#_type_editor]
// == Type Editor
//
// // tag::type-editor[]
// [.float-group]
// --
// image::{page-version}@drivers::studio/type-editor.png[Type editor, role=right framed, width = 50%, link=self]
//
// Type Editor is a powerful instrument that combines easy to use GUI with API calls that can modify schema types directly,
// without TypeQL queries.
// With Type Editor, it's much easier to rename a type or change type hierarchy by changing a supertype of a type.
// And it works even for types that already have data inserted for them.
//
// Type Editor window gives you a full overview of the selected type: its label, parent, owned attributes, played roles,
// owners (for attributes), related roles (for relations), subtypes, and whether it's an abstract type.
//
// Type Editor can rename a type, change its supertype, change whether it's an abstract type,
// add or remove owned attributes, related roles, played roles,
// as well as just delete a type or export its full definition.
//
// For the Type Editor be able to modify a schema,
// make sure to switch to the `schema` session and `write` transaction in the top toolbar.
// --
//
// === Rename a type
//
// To rename a type:
//
// . Open the Type Editor window by double-clicking on the selected type in the Type Browser.
// . At the very top, click on the pencil icon immediately right from the type name.
// . Edit the name in the Label field and press the btn:[Rename] button to save the changes.
// . Commit the transaction by the image:{page-version}@home::studio-icons/svg/studio_check.svg[width=24] btn:[Commit] button at the top toolbar.
// //#todo Add the pencil icon
//
// You can also do the same by right-clicking on the type in the Type Browser panel and choosing the Rename Type option.
//
// Renaming a type in any of these two ways updates the relevant type references in the schema and does not lead
// to loosing existing data.
// All existing instances of the type will be available under the new label.
//
// === Delete a type
//
// To delete a type:
//
// . Open the Type Editor window by double-clicking on the selected type in the Type Browser.
// . At the very bottom, click the btn:[Delete] button and then the btn:[Confirm] button.
// . Commit the transaction by the image:{page-version}@home::studio-icons/svg/studio_check.svg[width=24] btn:[Commit] button at the top toolbar.
//
// You can also do the same by right-clicking on the type in the Type browser panel and choosing the Delete option,
// then clicking the btn:[Confirm] button.
//
// In some cases, the btn:[Delete] option and button can be unavailable.
// That means there are some conditions that prevent you from deleting this type.
// For example,
// we can't xref:{page-version}@typeql::queries/undefine.adoc#_undefine_a_type_with_a_subtype[delete a type that has a subtype].
// // end::type-editor[]

// == Settings
//
// To see TypeDB Studio settings, open the *Manage Preferences* window by clicking on the button with the gear (image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_settings.svg[width=24]) icon
// in the top right corner of the window.
//
// TypeDB Studio has the following settings available:
//
// * Graph Visualiser
// ** Enable Graph Output -- Turns on visualization of query results as graphs on a separate tab of the *Run* panel. +
// Default value: *On*.
// * Project Manager
// ** Set Ignored Paths -- All paths mentioned here will be invisible in any Project directory opened in Studio. +
// Default value: `.git`.
// * Query Runner
// ** Default Get query Limit -- Limits the maximum number of results to be returned from a get query to a database
// if no limit explicitly stated in the query. +
// Default value: *1000*.
// * Text Editor
// ** Enable Autosave -- Enables autosave function for files opened in TypeDB Studio. +
// Default value: *On*.


[#_version_compatibility]
== Version Compatibility

// tag::compat-intro[]
If you're using TypeDB 3.0 or 3.1, you can still access the (unmaintained) legacy TypeDB Studio application in https://cloudsmith.io/~typedb/repos/public-release/packages/?q=name%3A%5Etypedb-studio&sort=-version[Cloudsmith].

Support for the legacy application was dropped in TypeDB 3.2; we encourage users to upgrade to TypeDB 3.2 to access the new TypeDB Studio.
