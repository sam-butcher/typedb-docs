:test-tql: custom
:test-tql-entry: schema_start

TypeDB brings together powerful programming concepts with the features and performance of modern database systems. We believe the result is a novel database experience - and after taking this 15-minute crash course, we hope you'll agree.

== Storing data in types

This queries will actually be run last ... check .adoc source, which has the `:test-tql-entry:` attribute set.

//!program[lang=tql, type=read, name=read_start]
//!++
[,typeql]
----
match
  $alex isa user, has username "grothendieck_25";
  $friendship isa friendship (friend: $alex, friend: $friend-of-alex);
reduce $alex-friend-count = count;
----
//!--

The next query is run in the same transaction.

//!++
[,typeql]
----
match
  $alex isa user, has username "grothendieck_25";
  friendship (friend: $alex, friend: $friend-of-alex); # can omit variable
reduce $alex-friend-count = count;
match
  $other-user isa user, has username $other-name;
  friendship (friend: $other-user, friend: $friend-of-other-user);
reduce $other-friend-count = count
  groupby $other-name, $alex-friend-count;
match
  $alex-friend-count < $other-friend-count;
select $other-name;
----
//!--
//!run

Here, we committed, and start a new transaction (see source).

//!program[lang=tql, type=read]
//!++
[,typeql]
----
with fun friend_count($user: user) -> integer:
  match friendship (friend: $user, friend: $friend-of-user);
  return count;
match
  $alex isa user, has username "grothendieck_25";
  $other-user isa user, has username $other-name;
  friend_count($alex) < friend_count($other-user);
select $other-name;
----
//!--
//!run

== Schema

This is actually the entrypoint of the page.

//!program[lang=tql, type=schema, name=schema_start]
//!++
[,typeql]
----
define
  entity user, owns username, owns status;
  attribute username, value string;
  attribute status, value string;
----
//!--

The next queries are still part of the same transaction

//!++
[,typeql]
----
define
  relation friendship, relates friend @card(2);
  user plays friendship:friend;
----
//!--

There could be some hidden queries as well (check the .adoc source!)

//!++
////
define
  attribute start-date, value datetime;
  friendship owns start-date @card(0..1);
////
//!--

...or parts of queries can be hidden

//!++
////
define
////
[,typeql]
----
  user owns status @card(0..);  # as many status attributes as you wish
  user owns username @key;
----
//!--

//!++
[,typeql]
----
define
  entity organization,
    owns username,
    owns status,
    plays friendship:friend;
----
//!--
//!run

Here we start a new transactions

//!program[lang=tql, type=schema]
//!++
[,typeql]
----
define
  entity company sub organization;    # subtypes will inherit ownership and role
  entity university sub organization; # playing traits from their supertype
----
//!--
//!run

== Insert data

This inserts are run in separate transactions (one of them will actually fail!). The last will jump back up to the read queries above.

This first query will fail actually! (Check the code)

//!program[lang=tql, type=write, fail_at=commit]
//!++
[,typeql]
----
insert $x isa user;
----
//!--
//!run

//!program[lang=tql, type=write]
//!++
[,typeql]
----
insert $x isa user, has username "user_0";
----
//!--
//!run

//!program[lang=tql, type=write]
//!++
[,typeql]
----
insert
  $x isa user, has username "user_1";
  $y isa user;
  $y has username "user_2";  # we can separate `isa` and `has`
----
//!--
//!run

While a previous programs fails at commit, this one fails at runtime:

//!program[lang=tql, type=write, fail_at=runtime]
//!++
[,typeql]
----
insert
  $x isa user, has username "user_3";
  $y isa user, has username "user_3";
----
//!--
//!run

//!program[lang=tql, type=write]
//!++
[,typeql]
----
insert
  $x isa user, has username "grothendieck_25";
  $y isa user, has username "hartshorne";
  friendship (friend: $x, friend: $y); # alternatively: $z isa friendship (friend: $x, friend: $y);
----
//!--
//!run

Small rust program in between
//!program[lang=rust]
//!++
[,rust]
----
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
----
//!--
//!run
//!program[lang=tql, type=write]
//!++
[,typeql]
----
match
  $u0 isa user, has username "user_0";
  $u1 isa user, has username "user_1";
  $u2 isa user, has username "user_2";
insert
  friendship (friend: $u0, friend: $u1);
  friendship (friend: $u0, friend: $u2);
  friendship (friend: $u1, friend: $u2);
----
//!--
//!run

We can also check specific counts:

//!program[lang=tql, type=write, count=0, jump=read_start]
//!++
[,typeql]
----
match
  $user isa user, has username "user_0";
insert $user has status "VIP";
match
  friendship (friend: $user, friend: $friend);
  friendship (friend: $friend, friend: $friend-of-friend);
  $friend-of-friend has status "VIP";
reduce $VIP-friend-count = count groupby $friend;
match $VIP-friend-count > 5;
insert $friend has status "VIP";
----
//!--
//!run
