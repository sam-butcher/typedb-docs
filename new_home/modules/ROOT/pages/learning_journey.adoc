= Learning journey

Welcome to our guide on how to best leverage these docs for learning TypeDB and TypeQL. 
It is designed to take you from being a beginner to an advanced user through a structured learning journey.

But don't feel the need to stick to our flow! 
Jump between sections based on your immediate needs and come back to fill in gaps as you grow more experienced with TypeDB.
Most pages in this documentation can be used with few pre-requisites and should be easy to understand independently.

== Step 1: TypeDB basics

* xref:{page-version}@new_home::introduction/what-is-typedb.adoc[What is TypeDB?]
* xref:{page-version}@new_home::introduction/why-typedb.adoc[Why TypeDB?]

== Step 2: Getting TypeDB

Choose your installation method based on your needs at xref:{page-version}@new_home::get-typedb/index.adoc[Get TypeDB].

You might also want to pop into the xref:{page-version}@new_tools::index.adoc[Tools] to read a bit more about TypeDB Studio and Console.

== Step 3: Quickstart

Once you have TypeDB installed, get up and running with a simple example at the xref:{page-version}@new_home::quickstart/index.adoc[quickstart].
This will teach you all the basics of TypeDB and TypeQL.

== Step 4: Examples

Explore some pre-built xref:{page-version}@new_examples::index.adoc[examples].

These include simple end-to-end examples of a traditional frontend & backend & database, a web app & database stack,
and also specific TypeDB schemas and queries applied to industry use-cases.

As you go through those examples we recommend having the Core Concepts open (see next section).

Some developers like to start with Concepts first, then look at examples, in which case
skip to the next section and come back to the examples afterward!

== Step 5: Core concepts

There are approximately 3 major parts to understanding TypeDB:

1. Learning about the TypeDB database server
2. Learning about the details of the TypeQL query language
3. Learning about the drivers that allow programmatic access to TypeDB

=== TypeDB

TypeDB server implements database and user management, authentication and connection protocols, transactions, and 
query execution. These are APIs are largely independent of the query language or the driver APIs.

Start at the xref:{page-version}@new_core_concepts::typedb/overview.adoc[TypeDB Overview] to learn about the TypeDB server.

=== TypeQL

Understanding how to "think in TypeQL", is the key part of using TypeDB effectively and at full power.

The xref:{page-version}@new_core_concepts::typeql/overview.adoc[TypeQL Overview],
shows the building blocks of the language and how they interact, from types to queries to functions.

=== TypeDB drivers

TypeDB can be accessed through either high-performance gRPC drivers or its built-in HTTP API.

TypeDB's gRPC drivers come with their own set of APIs and recommended usage patterns that 
are described at the xref:{page-version}@new_core_concepts::drivers/overview.adoc[Driver Overview]. 

== Step 6: Building your application

At this point you should have enough conceptual and practical knowledge of TypeDB to build
your proof-of-concept, or even a start building a production application!

In this building phase you will probably need to refer to any of the xref:{page-version}@new_reference::index.adoc[Reference] pages, 
which are descriptions of the all the different features of TypeDB, TypeQL, the protocol and drivers,
and libraries.

== Step 7: Operations

The xref:{page-version}@new_maintenance_operation::index.adoc[Operations] pages are for learning about backups, upgrades, configurations, and much more.

In addition, it could be useful to learn about automating TypeDB Cloud operations with the xref:{page-version}@new_tools::typedb-cloud-api.adoc[TypeDB Cloud API].
For example, you might want to integrate TypeDB Cloud into your deployment pipelines to spin up and down instances of TypeDB automatically.
