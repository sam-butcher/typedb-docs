= TypeDB Cloud

TypeDB runs as a service in TypeDB Cloud, our platform for automatically deploying TypeDB onto the cloud provider of your choice.

== Deploying a cluster

1. Sign up for TypeDB Cloud at https://cloud.typedb.com/sign-up
2. Navigate to the https://cloud.typedb.com?team_action=/clusters/deploy[cluster deployment page]
3. Configure your cluster, and click **Deploy**

== Cluster configuration

Paid clusters can be configured during deployment to select different technical specifications.
We offer a series of recommended configurations,
or you can enable advanced configuration for more options.

== After deploying

Once your cluster is deployed, you will be able to set the password for the default `admin` user.
Make sure to save this password somewhere safe, as you will need it to access your cluster.
